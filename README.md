# CSS Example

This repository aims to share knowledge about the most common css layouts and how to create them. The idea is to have a reference for future projects and to help others to understand how to create these layouts.

# Running the project

## Option 1: opening the html file in the browser

Open the `public/index.html` file in the browser. (the back button will not work in this case, because uses `/` as the base url)

## Option 2: using a server

You can use a nodejs server to run the project. To do that, follow the steps below:

1. Check and install nodejs on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

OBS: The specific version used in this project is on the `.tool-versions` file.

2. Run the server using the command below:

```bash
node server.mjs
```
